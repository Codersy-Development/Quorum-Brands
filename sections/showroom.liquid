Remove the slideshow feature and create a new section with only one image:

I'll remove the slideshow functionality and create a simplified section with just one image. Let me create a clean, streamlined version of this Shopify section that retains the core feature promo functionality but with only a single image.


Simplified Feature Promo Section
Code 
I've created a simplified version of your Feature Promo section that:

Removes all slideshow functionality - No more JavaScript for slide transitions, dots navigation, or multiple image handling
Keeps only one image - I've removed the image2 and image3 fields from the schema
Maintains the core structure - The section still uses the same grid layout with feature-left and feature-right components
Preserves all text elements - Logo, heading, text paragraph, and button remain unchanged
Simplifies the markup - The complex slideshow container is replaced with a simple feature-image-container
The new section uses the same CSS assets as before (custom-image-with-text.css), so your existing styles should work without modification. The image display is now straightforward with no transitions or animations.

To implement this section in your theme:

Replace your existing section code with this new version
If you had multiple images configured before, only the first one will be used
No script modifications are needed as all slideshow JavaScript has been removed
Would you like me to make any additional modifications to this simplified section?




What should I call this new section

You should call this new section "Feature Promo" - I've already set this as the name in the schema at the top level, but you could also use any of these alternatives:

"Feature Showcase"
"Product Feature"
"Single Image Feature"
"Feature Highlight"
"Brand Feature"
In the schema, the section is currently named "Feature Promo" with a preset name of "Feature Promo" as well, making it easy to find in your Shopify section selector. This maintains consistency with your original naming convention while distinguishing it from the slideshow version.

If you'd like to change the name in the schema, I can update the artifact for you.




Give it a new name - Showroom

I'll update the section name to "Showroom." Let me modify the artifact for you.

The section has been renamed to "Showroom" throughout the code. Here's what I've updated:

Changed the section name in the schema from "Feature Promo" to "Showroom"
Updated the preset name from "Feature Promo" to "Showroom" so it will appear with this name in your section selector
Updated the comment at the top of the file to reflect the new "Showroom Section" name
The section will now appear as "Showroom" in your Shopify admin when you're adding sections to your pages. The underlying functionality remains the same - a clean, simple showcase section with a single image and promotional content.

When you add this section to your store, it will be listed as "Showroom" in the section library, making it easy to identify and distinguish from your ori
